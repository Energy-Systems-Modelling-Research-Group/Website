                <p>The Energy System Modelling Research Group is part of the Institute of Energy and Environment of the University of Strathclyde. A main goal of our research is to develop methods to tackle operation and planning challenges in energy systems. We develop and maintain open-source Python tools that empower academics and researchers to conduct through analysis. Our research has led to several real-world industrial applications.</p>

                <p> 
                   Most of us need to study a bit more maths during our PhDs, so we've started a list of resources we've used to help us learn.
                   <ul>
                      <li> For general maths concepts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@richarde.borcherds7998/playlists">Richarde Borcherds</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown</a> on YouTube</li>
                      <li>For hypercubes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90olwwLdEYg">The Hypercube: Projections and Slicing Simulation</a>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W421AczpWLo"> Spinning Hypercubes</a> are both great simulations.</li>
