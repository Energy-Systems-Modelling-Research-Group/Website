                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>The Energy System Modelling Research Group is part of the Institute of Energy and Environment of the University of Strathclyde. A main goal of our research is to develop methods to tackle operation and planning challenges in energy system. We develop and maintain open-source Python tools that empower academics and researchers to conduct through analysis. Our research has led to several real-world industrial applications.</p>
